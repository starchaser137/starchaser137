- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @starchaser137
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in microcontrollers, CPU design and other low-level stuff, some 3D art in Blender, writing and watching SciFi stuff 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning NOTHING... I have exams - the perfect way to experiment what your world would look like if you killed all your passions.
