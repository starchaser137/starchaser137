- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @starchaser137
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in microcontrollers, CPU design and other low-level stuff, some 3D art in Blender, writing and watching SciFi stuff.
- ğŸŒ± I have school nowadays, so I try to give some time to my passions, but since there are so many of them, my output is varied.
